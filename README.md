==================

Tried a multiplayer mobile chess game using ionic and integrating firebase and auth0.
Pusher was an idea, but didn't make it yet.

Based on the chess engine [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) and a rendering engine suited for mobile [chessboard-js](https://github.com/caustique/chessboard-js)
